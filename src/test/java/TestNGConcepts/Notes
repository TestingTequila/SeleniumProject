1- Priority: To define the execution order of test cases.
             If the test cases have all, negative priority, No Priority(Default) and Positive priority, there order of
             execution will be Negative>Default>Positive
             In case No priority exists, TestNG will execute the test cases in Default alphabetical order

   enabled: This attribute can be used in cases where we don't wish to execute certain test cases
             enabled=false, will do so

   timeOut: This will check if a particular test case is executed within mentioned time or not
             timeOut = timeInMilliSeconds

   dependsOnMethods: This will decide, if the depending method is passed only then dependent method will execute, else it would be skipped
   dependsOnGroups:  This will decide, if the group of depending method is passed only then dependent method will execute, else it would be skipped
